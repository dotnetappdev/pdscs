# ðŸ§ª Test Suite Overview

This file describes all unit tests for the solution, written with **xUnit** and using the **EF Core InMemory** database for isolation and speed.

## What is Tested?
- **Repositories:**
  - Add, update, and delete operations for departments and persons
  - InMemory DB context setup and teardown
- **Validation:**
  - Department and person validation (e.g., required fields, max lengths)
  - FluentValidation rules
- **Error Handling:**
  - Ensures validation errors are returned and handled as expected
