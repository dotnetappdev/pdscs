### Node.js Directory Creation for Setup

If you encounter issues during setup (especially with SSL dev certificates or missing folders), the following code was added to the `aspnetcore.js` file to ensure required directories are created automatically:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Define your target folder path
const baseFolder = path.join(__dirname, 'some', 'nested', 'directory');

// Create the directory recursively
fs.mkdirSync(baseFolder, { recursive: true });

console.log(`Directory created at: ${baseFolder}`);
```

This helps prevent errors related to missing folders when running the app for the first time. If you have any setup issues related to SSL development certificates, ensure you have the correct permissions and that your dev certs are installed (see ASP.NET Core docs for `dotnet dev-certs https`).
